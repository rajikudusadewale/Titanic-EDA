# Titanic-EDA (codes)

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is an approach to analyzing and summarizing data that is used to understand its main features and patterns. 
**EDA** is typically used in the early stages of data analysis, to gain a deeper understanding of the data and to identify potential relationships 
or trends that can be explored in further detail.

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their *demographics, cabin class, 
fare paid*, and whether they survived the disaster

Based on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic dataset, the following conclusions and insights can be drawn <-

1. The majority of the passengers were in third class, with only a small percentage in first class.

2. The survival rate of passengers in first class was higher than those in second and third class.

3. Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than male passengers.

4. Passengers with family members onboard had a higher survival rate than those who were traveling alone.

5. The age distribution of passengers was skewed towards younger passengers, with a large number of passengers under the age of 30.

6. Passengers who paid higher fares tended to have a higher survival rate.

7. Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg had a higher survival rate compared to those who embarked from Southampton and Queenstown.

8. Cabin location had a significant impact on survival rate, with passengers in the upper decks having a higher survival rate.

Based on these findings, it can be concluded that social class, gender, age, family status, fare paid, embarkation port, and cabin location were all significant factors that influenced survival on the Titanic.

These insights can inform further analysis, such as predictive modeling to develop a model that accurately predicts survival on the Titanic based on these factors. Additionally, these insights may be useful for decision-making in other areas, such as disaster preparedness or transportation policy.
